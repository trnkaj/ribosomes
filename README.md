# ribosomes
This repository contains data and analytical R scripts for the manuscript "Pancreatic cancer cells exchange functional ribosomes through tunneling nanotubes" by Martínková et al.

The files XXXXXX_CellGlo_gemcit.csv are from three dose-response viability measurements and were analysed using the R-script-IC50-analysis.R. Results are shown in the first panel of Figure 1C.

The file TNTs-gemcitabine.xls contains three experiments counting TNTs formed after the exposure to varying concentrations of gemcitabine and was analysed using the R script TNTs-gemcitabine.R. Results are shown in the second and third panels of Figure 1C.
